Assignment 1 
Exploratory Data Analysis and Regression Modeling for Agricultural Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions 
Dataset Description 
The dataset is a structured agricultural emissions dataset developed to support climate analysis and 
decision-making in sustainable agriculture. It captures the relationship between agricultural practices, 
environmental conditions, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across diverse farming scenarios. Each 
record in the dataset represents an agricultural unit observed over a cultivation period and includes detailed 
information on crop type, fertilizer usage, irrigation patterns, and climate variables. Crop-related attributes 
describe the type of crop cultivated, while fertilizer-related features quantify nutrient application levels. 
Irrigation data reflect both the method and intensity of water usage. Climate variables include key 
atmospheric conditions such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity, which influence emission behavior and 
crop performance. 
The dataset provides emission indicators for major greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide 
(CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O), along with aggregated CO₂-equivalent values. In addition to 
baseline observations, the dataset contains explicitly labeled counterfactual scenarios representing 
alternative agricultural and climatic conditions. These scenarios enable comparative analysis of emission 
outcomes under different management and environmental settings.  
Designed with scalability and interoperability in mind, the dataset supports advanced analytical 
workflows and transparent evaluation of agricultural emission patterns. The structured format, combined 
with scenario labeling, makes the dataset suitable for benchmarking emission studies, sustainability 
assessments, and policy-oriented climate analysis in agriculture.

Detailed Task Description  
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing 
Load the dataset into Python using the Pandas library and display the first few rows to understand its 
structure. Identify the number of rows and columns and examine the data types of all variables. 
Check for missing values in each column and report your findings. If missing values are present, 
explain their meaning and handle them appropriately without removing a large portion of the data. 
Identify the numerical input columns to be used for modeling, such as fertilizer usage, irrigation 
water, temperature, rainfall, and humidity. Clearly define a dependent feature as the regression 
target. 
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
Generate descriptive statistics for all numerical variables using pandas. Report common measures 
such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation, and briefly explain what these 
statistics reveal about the data. Create simple visualizations to support your analysis. Plot histograms 
and boxplots for numerical variables to study their distributions and identify possible outliers. 
Develop visualizations that highlight descriptive statistics for each numerical feature, such as a bar 
chart showing the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation. 
Analyze relationships between key input variables and total greenhouse gas emissions using scatter 
plots. Compute a correlation matrix for numerical features and visualize it using a heatmap. 
Summarize at least three important insights obtained from the exploratory analysis. 
3. Linear Regression 
Formulate a regression problem using numerical agricultural and climate variables to predict total 
greenhouse gas emissions. Split the dataset into training and testing sets and train a linear regression 
model. Evaluate the model using Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R² score. Briefly 
interpret the results and explain which variables appear to have the strongest influence on emissions. 
4. Polynomial Regression 
Extend the linear regression model by applying polynomial features of degree two to the numerical 
input variables. Train a polynomial regression model and evaluate it using the same metrics as 
before. Compare the performance of linear and polynomial regression and comment on whether the 
polynomial model improves prediction accuracy. 
5. Classification Reformulation 
Convert the greenhouse gas emissions prediction problem into a classification task by selecting a 
discrete feature. Train and evaluate linear classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, 
and Perceptron. Assess model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, 
F1-score, and Confusion Matrix. Briefly discuss the results, highlighting the strengths and limitations 
of the classification approach, including information loss from discretization and its suitability for 
categorical decision-making scenarios.
